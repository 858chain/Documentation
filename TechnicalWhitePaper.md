# 858Chain Technical White Paper v1

**Jun 19, 2018**

**Abstract:** The 858Chain foundation introduces a new enterprise-grade hybrid blockchain platform designed to enable vertical and horizontal scaling of decentralized applications. This is archieved by creating an permissioned point to point chain system-like construct upon with applications can be built. the platform provides accounts, authentication, databases, asynchronous communication, and the scheduling of applications across many of CPU cores or clusters. The resulting technology is a blockchain architecture that may ultimately scale to millions of transactions per second, eliminates user fees, and allows for quick and easy deployment and maintenance of decentralized applications, in the context of a governed blockchain.

# Background

Hybrid blockchains are fairly unexplored and only few implementations exist; even in development. Quorum developed by JP Morgan is designed to be the hybrid blockchain in a fully permissioned environment. Truly Hybrid blockchain must necessarily be able to connect public blockchain with a private blockchain implementation running in a fully permissioned environment. The 858 hybrid blockchain aims to be exactly that, leveraging the power of both the public and private blockchain paradigms. 

Table 1 illustrates the comparison between public, private and hybrid blockchain systems

| Parameters               | Public Blockchain                 | Private Blockchain | Hybrid Blockchain                      |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------- | ------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| Transactional Visibility | Fully visible                     | Not visible        | Both; subject to use case              |
| Auditability             | Low                               | Low to High        | High                                   |
