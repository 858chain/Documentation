# 858Chain Technical White Paper v1

**Jun 19, 2018**

**Abstract:** The 858Chain foundation introduces a new enterprise-grade hybrid blockchain platform designed to enable vertical and horizontal scaling of decentralized applications. This is archieved by creating an permissioned point to point chain system-like construct upon with applications can be built. the platform provides accounts, authentication, databases, asynchronous communication, and the scheduling of applications across many of CPU cores or clusters. The resulting technology is a blockchain architecture that may ultimately scale to millions of transactions per second, eliminates user fees, and allows for quick and easy deployment and maintenance of decentralized applications, in the context of a governed blockchain.
